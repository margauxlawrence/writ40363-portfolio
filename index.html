                <p>Welcome to my page. I am happy you are here, feel free to look around! My name is Margaux Lawrence, and I am a Strategic Communication major at Texas Christian University with minors in Spanish and Digital Culture & Data Analytics. I am passionate about storytelling, design, and building community through communication, whether that is in the classroom, in my sorority, or through leadership organizations like Order of Omega and the Chancellors Leadership Program. With some experience in design, marketing, and event planning, I enjoy finding ways to connect people and ideas while growing my skills in public relations, advertising, and digital media.</p>

<!-- Candidate for CSS background -->
                <p>As part of my Strategic Communication coursework, I designed a promotional poster highlighting Adobe MAX, the annual creativity conference, tailored for students in the STCO program. The project emphasized both visual design and strategic messaging, requiring me to apply Adobe Creative Cloud tools while aligning with professional design principles. I incorporated strong typography, balanced layouts, and an engaging color scheme to capture attention and communicate the relevance of the event to creative professionals. This project not only strengthened my technical design skills in Adobe software but also demonstrated my ability to translate brand identity and complex information into a clear, visually compelling piece.</p>
