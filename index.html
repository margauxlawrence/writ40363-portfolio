                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hey there, I am Margaux! I am currently a junior at Texas Christian University majoring in Strategic Communications with a double minor in Spanish and Digital Cultures & Data Analytics with a focus on public relations, advertising, and marketing. I have always been passionate about connecting with people and sharing stories that inspire action, which led me to pursue a career in the marketing and communications field.</p>
                <p>During my time at TCU, I have been involved in organizations that have shaped me as a leader and communicator, including my sorority, Chi Omega, and the Chancellor’s Leadership Program. I have also had the privilege of serving on the executive boards of both the Alpha Delta chapter of Order of Omega and Special Olympics, where I have strengthened my leadership, organizational, and event-planning skills. While this is not comprehensive of all of my involvement, these are some of the organizations that have allowed me to grow personally and professionally while making a meaningful impact within my campus community.</p>
                <p>My goal is to work in sports marketing or brand strategy, combining my love for athletics and storytelling to create meaningful connections between brands and their audiences. I am passionate about using marketing to bring people together and inspire growth. Beyond academics and leadership, I value creativity, faith, and community — principles that shape how I approach my work, build relationships, and contribute to the organizations I am part of.</p>
