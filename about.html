                <h2><b>Background</b></h2>
                <p>I am a junior at TCU studying Strategic Communication with minors in Spanish and Digital Cultures & Data Analytics. This past summer, I worked at Kanakuk Kamp where I spent my days with kids, lived in a close-knit community, and spent plenty of time on the lake. It was a fun and rewarding experience that not only gave me memories with new friends, but also pushed me to grow as a leader and as a person. </p>
                <p>Outside of school and summer jobs, I love to travel and experience new places. Traveling is one of the ways I recharge and stay inspired—it is exciting to try new foods, explore different cities, and learn about cultures that are different from my own. Some of my favorite memories come from trips where I got to experience life in a new place and connect with people I otherwise would not have met. </p>
                <p>At TCU, I stay busy with campus involvement and spending time with friends, but I also enjoy the little moments of downtime. Whether that looks like going for a long run, studying in a coffee shop, or just sitting outside with people I care about, I really value finding balance in my day-to-day life. College has been a season of growth for me so far, and I am excited to see how my interests and passions continue to take shape over the next few years.</p>

                <h2><b>Goals</b></h2>
                <p>Through this course and my broader academic path, I aim to sharpen my technical skills in multimedia and digital communication while growing my creative problem-solving abilities. Beyond the classroom, my goal is to pursue a career in advertising, public relations, or sports marketing—fields where I can blend creativity with strategy to tell impactful stories. Ultimately, I hope to use my communication skills to build meaningful connections, amplify voices, and contribute to organizations that value innovation and community.</p>

                <h2><b>Skills and Learning</b></h2>
                <p>I bring a strong foundation in writing, public speaking, and visual design, with experience using Adobe Creative Cloud, Canva, and other digital media tools. My coursework and extracurriculars have also strengthened my skills in event planning, marketing strategy, and community building. At the same time, I am continuing to develop my coding abilities, multimedia authoring techniques, and deeper knowledge of digital analytics to better understand how technology shapes communication in our world today.</p>

                <h2>Intrests</h2>
                <p>I am curious about the ways communication, media, and culture intersect, and I enjoy exploring how creative design and storytelling influence the way we see the world. I’m especially passionate about sports, particularly Formula 1 and the NFL, because they combine strategy, competition, and global community in unique ways. I am also drawn to how sports marketing and media connect fans to the game and shape cultural conversations. Beyond that, I love traveling, spending time outdoors, and finding new ways to connect creativity with everyday life.</p>
