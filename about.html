            <h2><b>Background</b></h2>

        <p>I am a junior at TCU studying Strategic Communication with minors in Spanish and Digital Cultures & Data Analytics. This past summer, I worked at Kanakuk Kamp where I spent my days with kids, lived in a close-knit community, and spent plenty of time on the lake. It was a fun and rewarding experience that not only gave me memories with new friends, but also pushed me to grow as a leader and as a person. </p>
        <p>Outside of school and summer jobs, I love to travel and experience new places. Traveling is one of the ways I recharge and stay inspired—it is exciting to try new foods, explore different cities, and learn about cultures that are different from my own. Some of my favorite memories come from trips where I got to experience life in a new place and connect with people I otherwise would not have met. </p>
        <p>At TCU, I stay busy with campus involvement and spending time with friends, but I also enjoy the little moments of downtime. Whether that looks like going for a long run, studying in a coffee shop, or just sitting outside with people I care about, I really value finding balance in my day-to-day life. College has been a season of growth for me so far, and I am excited to see how my interests and passions continue to take shape over the next few years.</p>

            <h2><b>Fun Facts</b></h2>
            
            <p>A few fun facts about me—I got my name, <b>Margaux</b>, from the time my parents lived in France, which makes it a unique part of my story. I have traveled to <b>45 out of the 50</b> U.S. states and hope to check the last five off soon. I have also had the chance to swim with <b>sharks</b>, which was both terrifying and exciting. At home, I have three dogs,<b>Gus, Scarlett, and Teddy.</b> They are all rescues, who keep life fun and full of energy.</p>
