        <h1>My Acedemic and Professional Goals:</h1>

        <h2> In this class, </h2>
            
            <p>one of my main academic goals is to strengthen my ability to think critically and apply what I am learning to real-world situations. I want to not only understand the material but also practice using it in a way that feels practical and relevant to my future career. I see this course as an opportunity to build skills like research, analysis, and communication, which will help me grow as a student and give me more confidence in my academic work.</p>

        <h2>Professionally, </
            
            <p>I hope to take what I learn here and connect it to my long-term goals in marketing, communications, and the sports industry. I want to become more comfortable with tools and strategies that I can apply in internships and future roles, whether that is creating stronger content, understanding audiences better, or presenting ideas effectively. By the end of this course, I hope to have not only gained knowledge, but also developed a clearer sense of how these skills can be applied outside the classroom in ways that move me closer to my career goals.</p>
