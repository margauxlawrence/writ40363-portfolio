# Week 2 Reflection

**Confidence Check:**  
After two weeks in WRIT40363, I feel moderately confident with HTML. I’m comfortable with basic tags like headings, paragraphs, and links, but still find semantic structure and accessibility best practices a little challenging to keep straight.  Im getting there, but more time will lead to more confidence.

**Learning Curve:**  
Learning Git and GitHub has been pretty smooth. I feel as though nothing very challenging has come up for me. This has beena learning curve in the sense that this is something I have never done before, however, it is a welcome one to me. 

**Problem-Solving Growth:**  
When I ran into problems this week—like code not rendering correctly or being confused about Git—I tried to slow down and retrace my steps. I’ve started using online searches and documentation more effectively than in Week 1, instead of just guessing or starting over.  

**Professional Mindset:**  
The transition from “just making web pages” to “developing professionally with semantic HTML and version control” feels exciting. It makes me see my work as part of a larger skillset, though it’s a little overwhelming to think about all the conventions I don’t know yet.  

**Week 2 Reflection:**  
My biggest “aha moment” was realizing how semantic HTML improves accessibility and clarity for both users and developers. It clicked that these tags aren’t just for style—they actually carry meaning that shapes how others (and even screen readers) interact with the page.  

**Looking Forward:**  
I’m most curious about learning CSS and how design choices connect to functionality. At the same time, I feel nervous about diving deeper into Git workflows since there’s still so much I don’t fully grasp.  

**Support and Resources:**  
Hands-on practice and class discussions have been the most helpful for my learning so far. Moving forward, I am excited to see how things continue to move forwards for me. Office hours were very helpful for me last time, so I would not hesitate to go back if I found myself lost.
